Serasa - Machine Learning API helps you predict your data using three input strategies. ðŸš€

## Predict Single Input

You can make predictions by calling the **/predict-single** endpoint with a json in the format:

```json
{
  "feat1": 10,
  "feat2": 20,
  "feat3": 30
}
```

## Predict Batch Input

You can make predictions by calling the **/predict-batch** endpoint with a json in the format:

```json
{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "feat1": 10,
      "feat2": 20,
      "feat3": 30
    },
    {
      "feat1": 0,
      "feat2": 2,
      "feat3": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

## Predict CSV file Input

You can make predictions by calling the **/predict-file** endpoint and sending a multipart CSV file in the format:

```csv
feat1,feat2,feat3
10,20,30
1,0,0
0,0,1
1,1,0
10,0,0
```
